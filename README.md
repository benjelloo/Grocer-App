# Grocery
Grocery is an app that promotes social distancing measures while making our stay-at-home lives a little more convenient.
Users can send order requests for produce or grocery items they require, while other users that may already be on a grocery run can fulfill and deliver the requested item for a small delivery tip. With this system, there is extra incentive for those already on shopping trips to help others out with their needs.

## Try the App:
Ensure the Google Play Services SDK is installed (check in Android Studio through Tools>SDK Manager>SDK Tools).
Check Firebase documentation for dependencies that may need to be installed (although the current gradle files should be fine).

This project was submitted to the Lumiata COVID-19 Hackathon.
